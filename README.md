```sh
$ sudo npm install -g artillery
```

## Problem encountered



### Tech
Amazon ses uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - Evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
* [MongoDB] - MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program.

### Dev Tech
Amazon SES uses a number of open source projects to make development faster, efficient and automate the build process:

* [eslint] - A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. Maintain your code quality with ease.!
* [gulp] - Gulp is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development work flow, so you can stop messing around and build something.
* [mocha] - A test framework running on node.js and the browser which runs tests serially, mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.
* [nodemon] - Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.
* [should] - should is an expressive, readable, framework-agnostic assertion library.
* [supertest] - Super-agent driven library for testing node.js HTTP servers using a fluent API
* [istanbul] - A JavaScript code coverage tool written in JS

### Installation - Testing

* Clone the branch from [github]().
* Install MongoDB.
* Config the all the server details into one of the `config file`.

Install the dependencies and dev dependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd queue-man\src
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### For development build we can use gulp
Install the gulp command

```sh
$ npm install --global gulp-cli
```

Runs run gulp automatically rebuilds and check for eslint code quality

```sh
$ gulp
```

## TODO
* User priority checking API need to be implemented
* TS / IS an API check whether user came from queue system or not 
* Who is consuming queue data after dumping data in to the Redis?
